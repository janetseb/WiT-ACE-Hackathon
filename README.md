<h1>Eco-amica</h1>

<h3><b>Problem statement</b></h3><br><p>A survey by the Energy and Resources Institute has found that almost 90% felt that improper waste management in India posed a moderate to severe health risk, but less than half would separate organics for recycling.This is a significant issue and can prove to be catastrophic in the long run.</p>
<p>In each household, the waste accumulating can be broadly classified as Bio-degradable and Non bio-degradable. This can be further categorized as old newspaper, food waste, used electronic gadgets, medicines etc. Each of these waste require different forms of treatment/disposal and often are not properly taken care of.</p><br>
<h3><b>Solution</b></h3><br><p>To solve this problem, we create a mechanism which can implemented with the help of a mobile application. Anybody can create an account in this application and can post an image of the item they wish to dispose. It should be tagged as biodegradable or non bio degradable. The owner should also  label the item based on its category , material and object. Depending on the nature of the material, it can be either be recycled, disposed appropriately or can be reused by other individuals. After  posting the image of an item on the app, based on the nature of the item, the app automatically connects to agencies or individuals who will take care of the item sustainably.</p>
